<div class="qo-description">In most parts of Canada we have very distinct seasons. Some months of the year are temperate and relatively dry, while other months are cold and snowy. As a result, most Canadian towns of any size have stores that sell skis and bikes. Of course, they dont inventory both skis and bikes at the same time. Rather, in the spring they sell off all their ski related inventory and set out their bike</div>
